## Project Description
This is an educational project named **Plan Trip**, a web page for travel planning, developed by me, a student of The Odin Project. 
Users will be able to register to store their itineraries, create new ones, and access various features of the platform. 
The web page uses **Flexbox** for layout, ensuring that all elements are flexibly arranged and can easily adjust to different screen sizes and resolutions.

## Features

1. **HTML Structure** - The page is structured using semantic HTML5 elements, making the code easy to understand and navigate.
2. **CSS Styling** - External CSS is used to style the page, including layouts, buttons, typography, and responsive design.
3. **CSS Reset** - A reset stylesheet (`reset-modern.css`) is included to ensure cross-browser consistency.
4. **Responsive Design** - The page is designed using **Flexbox**, allowing for flexible and responsive layouts that adapt well to both desktop and mobile devices.
5. **Google Fonts** - The **Roboto** font is used throughout the project to maintain a clean and modern look.

## Page Sections

1. **Hero Section** - The main banner with a welcome message and a registration button.
2. **Information Section** - A block explaining the platform's features.
3. **Quote Section** - A section with an inspiring quote motivating users to travel.
4. **Action Section** - A section with a call to action and a registration button.
